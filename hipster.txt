Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.

Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.

Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind.
