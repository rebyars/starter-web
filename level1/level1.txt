I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. That's my family Kay, that's not me. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.
